    "## Hands-on session: The spherical harmonics dwarf\n",
    "Andreas Mueller, ECMWF (andreas.mueller@ecmwf.int)\n",
    "___\n",
    "**Remark:** This version of the spectral transform practical requires that all necessary Python modules have already been installed. If you want to run this notebook on your own computer please use the version at https://github.com/anmrde/spectral/tree/master/jupyter. The version on github.com includes commands to install all of the necessary Python modules on your machine.\n",
    "___\n",
    "**Abstract:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Many global atmospheric models are based on the spectral transform method with spherical harmonics. Transforming the fields from physical space to spectral space converts spatial derivatives into algebraic expressions. This makes the spectral transform method a very efficient approach for solving differential equations. One of the atmospheric models based on the spectral transform method with spherical harmonics is the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). IFS is used very successfully by the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) for operational weather prediction. We will look in this exercise at the spherical harmonics dwarf which is the code that performs the spectral transform in IFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of this exercise will be on writing a simple spectral transform code to get a better understanding of the spectral transform method. This will allow the students to understand the basic functionality of the dwarf. The code written by the students will also serve as an example for improving the performance of scientific code in general. We will consider different strategies to analyse and optimise the efficiency of code. This makes this exercise not only well suited for students who are interested in understanding the fundamental idea behind the spectral transform method but also for students who want to learn how to improve the computational performance of their own code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code of IFS is written in Fortran. To make it easier to experiment with different implementations and to easily plot the results we use Python in this (Jupyter) Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Motivation\n",
    "Creating interactive plots in Python in which you can rotate the earth and look at fields plotted on the globe from all directions does not result in satisfying performance. For this reason most of the globe visualisations can be found in a little web-app created with Javascript. You can find it here: http://anmrde.github.io/spectral\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task:** If you have not already done so please visit this web-app and do the quizzes in there! This web-app teaches you all of the main ideas behind the spectral transform method and is a great preparation for this Jupyter notebook."

The number in our fileName is this maximum wave number $M$. The other index $n$ is the so called total wave number and goes from $m$ to $M$.

An important open scientific question is: how can we filter unwanted oscillations without loosing much amplitude?\n",

This is usually done for fields like the wind velocity because the square of wind velocity has the physical meaning of the kinetic energy. It can also be very useful to plot the spectrum even for quantities like the geopotential.\n",
